\title{Make input matrix}
\usage{
makeInputMatrix(names_list, matCV, pro, input_dir, min_cpgs = c(5, 3))
}
\arguments{
\item{names_list}{A list of sample names.}

\item{matCV}{A matrix of covarites which are included into analysis. Ideally, users can include any covariate
that will be correlated with promoter DHcR in tumor samples and a hugo symbol column must be included.
An example can be loaded by using invisible(matCV). This covarite matrix contains following columns:
Hugo, DHcR_normal, PDR_normal, GEXP_Normal, Reptime.}

\item{pro}{A GRanges object containing promoter annotation.}

\item{input_dir}{A string indicates where DHcR and PDR files of all the samples are stored.
DHcR files should be named as DMC.sample_name.txt format.
PDR files should be named as PDR.sample_name.txt format.}

\item{min_cpgs}{A list of two integer value >= 0L. (Minimum number of CpGs requied by promoterDHcR,
Minimum number of CpGs required by promoterPDR).}
}
\value{
A data frame used as input for hypermethylation inference.
    \itemize{
      \item Id: Sample Id
      \item Hugo: Hugo symbol
      \item Covariates included in matCV
      \item PDR_Tumor: PDR level in tumor samples
      \item Depth_Tumor: Average sequencing depth in tumor samples
      \item CpGs_Tumor: Number of covered CpGs in tumor samples
      \item DHcR_Tumor: DHcR level in tumor samples
    }
}
\description{
Add DHcR, PDR and sequencing depth information of samples to be infered into input matrix.
